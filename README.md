# Re-Learn_Python
First Repo to relearn GitHub, Git, and Python. Practice using new APIs.


# Installing TWEEPY (Twitter API for Python)
!!!To install Tweepy you must be using python3!!!


	Instructions come from the Tweept Github website (https://github.com/tweepy/tweepy)
		Enter the following into a MAC OS Terminal with Python3 installed:

			git clone https://github.com/tweepy/tweepy.git
			cd tweepy
			python3 setup.py install

	To check with version of Python you are using do: "python --version"
	If it comes back as python2.X then do: "which python"
	It will show the location Python is installed. I do not recommend changing PATH to use Python3

	Instead just do: "which python3". If you get a result then it is installed. Whenever you want to run a Python script just run: "python3 <SCRIPT NAME>" instead of "python <SCRIPT_NAME>"
